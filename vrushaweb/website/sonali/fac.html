 after meals and take care of cleanliness in the dining
 hall. The food is simple but nutritious.</font>

<br><br><font size="5">Each hostel has a library of text books and literary books.
 Keeping in mind the high cost of text books, Samiti issues
 one set of text books to a group of 3 students free of 
charge for their use during their stay in the hostel. 
This saves considerable expense for them. 
Each hostel also has a reading room where students can
 study in comfort and peace during the day or night. 
Several prominent news papers and magazines are subscribed
 to for each hostel for use of the students.</font>

<br><br><font size="5">Recognising the need for students to be computer literate
 if they have to face the world in the present times, Samiti has 
set up a computer centre in each hostel where students can learn
 and practice on computers. In fact, Samiti has made a rule that
 students who are not computer literate must acquire the skill 
within one year failing which their admission would not be renewed.
