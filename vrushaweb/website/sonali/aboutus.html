<font size="5"><p>Pune is considered as the epicentre of education of Maharashtra and India. Because of a large number of private 
and government colleges and institutions offering courses in a wide variety of fields in Pune, a large number of 
students from all over India and foreign countries come to Pune for higher education. Students from economically weaker
 families from rural areas cannot afford the cost of living in a college or private hostel apart from the college 
and other educational expenses and many of them have to give up their plans for higher education which would improve
 the standard of living of their families.</p></font>
