The hostel rooms are spacious and well ventilated. 
Each room accommodates 2 to 4 students depending on 
the size of the room. Each student is provided with a
 bed, a mattress, a table, a chair, a cupboard or shelf,
 light, fan etc.

Each hostel has a spacious dining hall and kitchen.
 Students themselves are expected to wash their plates
 after meals and take care of cleanliness in the dining
 hall. The food is simple but nutritious.

<font size="5"face="algerian"><b><u>MEDICAL AID</b></u></font><br><br>

Each hostel has a clinic where qualified doctors (most 
of whom are ex-students of Samiti) provide treatment for 
minor illnesses. Each student has to undergo a medical 
check up once in each a year.
<br><br>
<font size="5" face="algerian"><b><u>LIBRARY</b></u></font><br><br>

Each hostel has a library of text books and literary books.
 Keeping in mind the high cost of text books, Samiti issues
 one set of text books to a group of 3 students free of 
charge for their use during their stay in the hostel. 
This saves considerable expense for them. 
Each hostel also has a reading room where students can
 study in comfort and peace during the day or night. 
Several prominent news papers and magazines are subscribed
 to for each hostel for use of the students.

<font size="5" face="algerian"><b><u>COMPUTER CENTRE</b></u></font><br><br>

<br><br>

Recognising the need for students to be computer literate
 if they have to face the world in the present times, Samiti has 
set up a computer centre in each hostel where students can learn
 and practice on computers. In fact, Samiti has made a rule that
 students who are not computer literate must acquire the skill 
within one year failing which their admission would not be renewed.
