Pune is considered as the epicentre of education of Maharashtra and India.
 Because of a large number of private and government colleges and institutions offering courses in a wide 
variety of fields in Pune, a large number of students from all over India and foreign countries come to
 Pune for higher education. Students from economically weaker families from rural areas cannot afford the
 cost of living in a college or private hostel apart from the college fees and other educational expenses
 and many of them have to give up their plans for higher education which would improve the standard of living
 of their families.</br></br>

comprising heads of reputed colleges and educational institutions. The administration is conducted by employed
